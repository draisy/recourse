                                        <p>"I very much enjoyed the classes. It was a pleasure to be able to participate fully. The
                                            screen presentation helped with processing the new terms. The Yiddish translation was
                                            a wonderful aid and serves as a great review tool. I acquired an abundance of knowledge,
                                            as well as advice on how to invest, and from which deals to keep a healthy distance.
                                            I'm presently in the process of studying for my real estate license, and your lessons
                                            are the reason for my success in school as I'm familiar with much of the subject matter.
                                            The class on halacha was extremely important, especially the topic of "ribis." Rabbi
                                            Stein's shiur was very interesting. But above all, your friendliness and patience are
                                            amazing, but is surpassed by your willingness to remain in contact to guide and advise,
                                            even after the classes had ended. Thank you!"

                                            Lazer Aron. It is unbelievable how I met some of my friends that are already active players

                            <h3>Recent Interview with Aron Gottlieb of the NY Real Estate Course</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <h4> Tell me about yourself.</h4>
                                    <p> I have been managing properties for close to 15 years. I have also been involved in acquisitions,
                                        due diligence, lease negotiations, etc... with all types of tenants, ranging from
                                        Bank of America to heimishe retail stores</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>What is the real estate course?</h4>
                                    <p> The course is designed to give the heimishe tzibbur a very informative education about
                                        investing in real estate. Without the proper knowledge it would be risky to enter
                                        this field. Several yingerleit told me that they already lost tens or hundreds of
                                        thousands of dollars because they didn’t know basic information that was necessary
                                        to start investing. They were very excited to be able to come to a course designed
                                        for them.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>How is the course designed?</h4>
                                    <p>The course is a wealth of information and accumulated knowledge that is condensed into
                                        a very manageable number of classes. The most general and important rules of the
                                        game are taught with a laid-back and easy- to-understand approach. I am not a professor;
                                        I never went to college. I am simply someone who is out in the field every day doing
                                        this, and I understand the mindset of the heimishe crowd and to what they relate.
                                        I have had the privilege of speaking at several events for the heimishe tzibbur and
                                        was told that my presentation was very unique and easy to understand. So I put together
                                        16 classes, starting with defining basic terminology, and concepts like cap rates,
                                        NOI, absorption rates, vacancy rates cam, syndication, etc... I had it translated
                                        into Yiddish, too, for those who have an easier time reading in Yiddish, and I provide
                                        a paper handout at every class for the oilum to read and review. </p>
                                    <p> We also have a hotline where they can call in to listen and review the classes later,
                                        in case they missed a class or missed a point and need to make a “chazura”. I distributed
                                        a dictionary with over 450 words common to real estate vocabulary, translated into
                                        Yiddish. While it was a huge task to put together, the class really appreciated it.
                                        I have people in the class who are straight out of kollel, and others who are already
                                        working and successful, but want to get educated in the field before they invest.
                                        So I try to make the classes relatable for people of all levels. I also share many
                                        personal experiences from which they can learn (i.e. my mistakes!). We also introduce
                                        several ways of earning an income in real estate-related fields. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h4>I have heard that many people have gained a lot of knowledge at your course. Please tell
                                    me a little about what is taught.</h4>
                                    <p>Firstly, I teach about the general kinds of real estate, such as residential, commercial,
                                        multi family, office, retail... and the risks and rewards associated with each one.
                                        Then, how to look and evaluate a property; how to make an offer (LOI); how to negotiate
                                        the terms, etc.; how to make the necessary due diligence; how to look for investors
                                        and financing;what to expect at closing; and how to manage the property. We are even
                                        presenting a class on using Excel to evaluate a property. In short, I am giving the
                                        class all the basic necessary information needed to delve into this field. </p>
                                    <p>One of my students was interviewed for a job at a real estate company. When asked what
                                        experience or knowledge he has, he answered that he is in the middle of a course.
                                        The owner then asked if it’s this guy from Lakewood, Aron Gottlieb? He replied affirmatively.
                                        This successful businessman then told him that he’d heard from other people that
                                        they’re learning in 8 weeks what it took him 2-3 years to learn! This student felt
                                        great about having taken the time and expense to sign up.</p>

                                    <h4>So how long will your course be?</h4>
                                    <p>The current course, which is now wrapping up, was 8 weeks for 2 hours each Sunday. I
                                        plan on making this a 6-week course, however, each class will be 2 hours and 45 minutes,
                                        with a short lunch break. The next course is planned to start in February in Boro
                                        Park on Sundays from 1:15 to 4pm. For more information, it’s best to contact me directly
